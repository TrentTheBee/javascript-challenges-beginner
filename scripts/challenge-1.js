/*
 Challenge 1: Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
    
    Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
    Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. 
    While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could 
    output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little 
    extra effort.

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line

let value = 0
let table = 0
while (table != 10) {
   table = table + 1;
   output.innerText += table;
   while (value != 10) {
      value = value + 1;
      output.innerText += "", "" + table * value;

   }
   output.innerText += "\n";
   value = 0
